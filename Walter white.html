          well respected chemistry teacher by his colleagues but was sometimes
          mocked by his students. besides being a chemsitry teacher walter
          worked at a gas station where he cleaned cars to earn some extra money

          walter white gets diagnosed with cancer which walter doesn't tell his

          after walter goes on a arrest with his brother hank he gest the idea
          of producing and selling meth under the name Heisenberg to make as
          much money as he can to leave it his family when he dies. as the
          seasons progress you see walter slowly lose himself and become and
          more like Heisenberg.
